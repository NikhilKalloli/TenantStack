Think of TenantStack Hub like a big apartment building:

What is it?


It's like a system that helps you manage multiple websites/content for different clients
Each client gets their own private "apartment" (content space) that only they can access
You (as the building manager) can manage everything from one central place


Real World Example:
Imagine you're a web design agency:


You have 10 different clients
Each client needs their own website and content
Instead of managing 10 separate systems, you use TenantStack Hub to manage all of them in one place


Main Parts (Services):


API Service: The main reception desk - handles all requests and directions
Tenant Manager: The building manager - assigns spaces and manages resources
Auth Service: The security guard - checks who can enter and what they can do
Audit Logger: The security camera - keeps track of everything that happens
